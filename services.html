                     <p>Here at Fresh Renewed Wellness our certified injectors use Botox. Botox works by relaxing the targeted muscles, which can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines on the face. Botox is commonly used to smooth out facial wrinkles, such as crow's feet, frown lines, and forehead lines, giving the skin a more youthful and refreshed look. An average amount of botox that is used is 20-50 units. And on average botox needs to be refilled between 3-9 months. </p>
